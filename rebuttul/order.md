Table.R2 Let 0,1,2 correspond to neutron physics, solids, and fluids, respectively. The standard deviation approaches the uncertainty of the diffusion model itself, as shown in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiSimDiff-D5A3/std.md. The results on the test set are as follows:
| Order    | Neutron  | Solid    | Fluid    |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0 1 2    | 0.01376  | 0.02755  | 0.03864  |
| 0 2 1    | 0.01357  | 0.02754  | 0.03865  |
| 1 2 0    | 0.01404  | 0.02760  | 0.03875  |
| 1 0 2    | 0.01425  | 0.02754  | 0.03863  |
| 2 0 1    | 0.01347  | 0.02750  | 0.03845  |
| 2 1 0    | 0.01375  | 0.02760  | 0.1833   |
| **Mean** | 0.01381  | 0.02756  | 0.03862  |
| **Std**  | 0.000291 | 0.000037 | 0.000111 |
